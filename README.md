NASA has eighteen satellite missions studying the Earth, and three Earth-observing instruments aboard the International Space Station (ISS).  Additionally, several more missions are scheduled for launch in the coming years.

Your challenge is to develop a tool to allow a person to virtually experience riding aboard one of NASA’s current satellites as it orbits the Earth. 

 What would you see when you looked down at Earth? What about when you looked around?  Wave at the other satellites as you pass each other, and watch out for debris! Be sure to look out for the ISS and greet your fellow astronauts!

As you enjoy your tour around the globe, think about all the data these space instruments generate!  Many Earth science problems require combining and comparing data from multiple instruments. So, as you orbit over the same stretch of Earth as a fellow satellite, or collect data for a region with ground sensors, ask yourself—are you measuring values from the same place at the same time? 

Solving this problem of colocation—determining when two instruments are observing the same patch of the Earth—is not a simple task. Multiple satellites can cross the same geographic area at the same time, but that doesn't mean they're looking at the same patch of land. Individual instruments have different fields of view.  For example, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on the Terra and Aqua satellites can see 2,330 km from side to side, but the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on CALIPSO can only see 70 m across, per orbit! In addition to having different orbital characteristics from one another, satellites also undergo orbital changes over their lifetimes as they are launched, adjusted, and eventually run out of fuel. 

As you plan your ride around our home planet, incorporate a tool or tools to determine co-localized data points from other instruments and visualize them! 



### Dictionary Earth

> Develop a creative way for the public and scientists alike to learn the definitions of Earth-related scientific and technical terms, using the power of crowdsourcing.

![Dictionary Earth](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/vidBdNJBDdf2eXhkOSeGFHHTlxk=/676/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Aerosol optical depth, free-air anomaly, catchment area, Lagrange points, vicarious calibration… these are a sample of the thousands of “jargon” terms NASA Earth scientists and engineers use every day to talk about their work.



NASA’s Earth-observing missions study our planet’s atmosphere, vegetation, interior, water, and interaction with the Sun and space. Each of these fields, themselves divided into numerous specialties, is accompanied by its own suite of technical terms. 

Navigating the resulting accumulation of names and terms is a problem not just for members of the public who want to understand NASA’s work and our planet, but also for scientists and engineers from different fields who want to work together. Having the ability to consult a shared dictionary would allow people to talk in the same language, and help build a deeper understanding of Earth science.

Your challenge is to develop a creative tool for science enthusiasts and scientists to share and learn the definitions of Earth-related scientific and technical terms.

 Harness the power of crowdsourcing and allow different users to add and edit entries. Think about how you would monitor the entries for accuracy, and how you would allow proper credit to be given through referencing.  Finally, how will you make exploring the dictionary a fun and interactive experience for all?



### Earth Cool

> Make a video to tell your story of how “Earth is cool!”

![Earth Cool](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/GAmNp5VSFcjJfKIz3-kOgrYNLwY=/659/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Earth is hot; Earth is cold. 

Earth is wet; Earth is dry.  

Earth is bright; Earth is dark.

Earth is 





Your challenge is to make a video to tell the world how awesome Earth is!  

Use your imagination and tell your story of why Earth is special to you.   

What are your favorite parts about our home planet?  Are they snow-capped mountains or tiny little ladybugs?  Are they coffee beans or cocoa beans?  Are they meandering rivers or towering glaciers?  Are they your neighbors or your friends in other countries?  Whatever makes the blue planet special to you, we want to hear about it!!

You can share a poem or a song, a dance or a presentation!  You can even make a welcome video for someone who just arrived on our planet!  The sky’s the limit! Well… not really!



### 1d 2d 3d Go

> Create tools that visualize Earth science missions and their data in three dimensions!

![1d 2d 3d Go](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/S4NuZjR3MlEo6XmSukUvkx6Lcs8=/671/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Web apps are a powerful medium to communicate the operations of satellite missions, and to visualize data from these missions.  This challenge invites you to build interactive 3D web tools that present Earth science missions and associated data visualizations. 

Available code libraries for interactive 3D web-apps are general purpose, and published NASA data sets were not specifically formatted for the free 3D code libraries. Modern web browsers can present 3D graphics via WebGL. Free open source code libraries and free 3D models enable the development of interactive space mission visualizations. Free web page hosting services enable citizen scientists to deploy their web apps.  

Your challenge is to develop interactive 3D tools that display trajectories, spacecraft, instrumentation, Earth coverage, and data visualizations! 

Research previous and ongoing Earth science missions and available data, and develop a tool that explains the mission or visualizes the data collected.  Design your tool to engage the general public, especially teachers and students!

The Web-based Space Mission Visualization Tutorial presentation, identified in the Resources section, provides links to free 3D WebGL code libraries, a code library for satellite trajectories, tutorials for converting trajectory data for display in a web app, and demonstrations of interactive 3D web apps. 

Several NASA projects and previous Space Apps Challenge products are available on an open source code repository. The code repository offers free web page hosting; so, projects can provide their source code and host a web page with the embedded web app within the same repository. 

Source code and models for interactive 3D web apps must be free for reuse, well commented and documented, and demonstrated via a working web app embedded in web page.  Code and models ought to be written so that they can be adapted and reused by citizen scientists interested in designing their own space missions. 



NASA provides several 3D web resources for technical information, tutorials, demonstrations, spacecraft models, and links to code libraries:



1) NASA Technical Report Server (NTRS) – a document repository with a wealth of information about Earth Science missions. With respect to this challenge, the presentation “Web-based Space Mission Visualization” (WSMV) identifies free JavaScript code libraries and provides links to demonstrations and tutorials:

- 



- 



- Tutorials and demonstrations linked to the WSMV presentation:

3) NASA’s Open Data portal – An excellent starting point for finding data sets, reusable code, and Application Programming Interfaces.

4) 



 

5) 



6) 



7) NASA’s 



 – A free space mission trajectory design application.

11) Analytical Graphic Inc’s. System Tool Kit (STK11) is another mission planning tool. 

A button in the STK11 user interface enables export of a mission model in the Cesium Modeling Language (CZML) format.



### Small Spaces Big Ideas

> Create crew-friendly designs for a habitat and/or its multi-use furniture, to be used for isolation studies on Earth that are researching the environmental and human dimensions of life on another planet.

![Small Spaces Big Ideas](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/_3CR4Fbh8Hj54u2GD68HzJ0UIkk=/672/fill-1440x200-c100/)

HI-SEAS (Hawai’i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) is a NASA-sponsored research program that is studying crew cohesion and selection for long-duration space missions. A crew of six lives in a habitat (the “hab”) that is a 1200 square-foot dome situated in a lava field on a site that is visually and geologically similar to Mars. 

This small 1200 square-foot space has to serve many roles:  

Your challenge is to design a layout for the hab that would accommodate all the activities that take place inside it.  You may also, or instead design an energy- or space-saving piece of furniture or appliance to be used in the hab.

 

Think of the usability of your designs on Earth!  Can they be applied to develop sustainable settlements in cities or villages?



When designing the hab layout:

### Data Concierge

> Develop an artificial intelligence tool to help Earth science data users and enthusiasts find datasets and resources of interest!

![Data Concierge](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/XeRkmZgWK_FXNIXMF2d4wf7MLOU=/673/fill-1440x200-c100/)

With eighteen satellites and three instruments aboard the International Space Station observing the Earth, Earth science enthusiasts and Earth data users have access to terabytes of information to browse and use at their fingertips!

Your challenge is to design an artificial intelligence tool to help Earth science data consumers navigate NASA’s Earth science datasets and resources! 

 Help users identify which datasets are useful to them and how to access them.  



### Bring Your Own Solution

![Bring Your Own Solution](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/I9VJt4bBy41V4MqDVF_hlwQ7nM4=/708/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Take a look at the resources we have provided, maybe you’ll find something to inspire you.

You can work in a team on something that you're all passionate about.





## Our Ecological Neighborhood

### Migratory Travels And Travel Stories

> Pick a migratory species of your choice and build a tool that shows the distribution of their available habitats, and track their sightings in real time!

![Migratory Travels And Travel Stories](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/x8fRiyY2R7yh_tDxhB_1pmOreFU=/666/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Migratory species travel around the world each year in the air, over land, and in the seas.  

Pick a migratory species of your choice and build a tool to show the distribution of their available habitats.  Allow users of your tool to track sightings of said species and input them into your visualization.

  

Here, we provide the example of the great North American monarch butterfly, which crosses over national boundaries to link three countries together in its migration corridor!  You can design a tool that helps users track these butterflies as they travel across their migration corridor.

Take it to the next level and show the environmental conditions in the species’ habitats and along their routes of travel.  Think about what environmental factors are important for the species’ survival, and what factors they are sensitive to.  For example, did you know that monarch butterflies need ultraviolet light to charge their internal magnetic compass, allowing them to orient themselves based on the Earth’s magnetic field? 

Use your tool to demonstrate habitat connectedness, and to identify emerging gap areas. Help users identify if their location is on or near these gaps along the migration route, so they can take action to help support habitat preservation for the species’ populations.   For example, users along the monarch butterfly migration routes can find habitat gaps and plant monarch food- and egg-laying plants in back yards, in parks, or on roofs, to help monarch populations. 

Finally, allow users to see how the landscape, the land cover, and the environment along the species’ migration corridor have changed over time.  Have these changes affected their migration patterns? 





### Our Planet Our Home

> Compare NASA Earth science data with data about people and tell your own story of human-environment interactions!

![Our Planet Our Home](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/mweog5oxbeKrsSo6p62PDsekrIk=/667/fill-1440x200-c100/)

As the human population on Earth grows, we continue to shape and to be influenced by the environments we live in.  What are some ways in which you and your community affect the environment?  How do the local and global environments influence your life; for example, your day-to-day actions, and trends in your community?

Your challenge is to overlay Earth science data with human dimensions data from resources like NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators Database, to see if any interesting patterns and stories emerge!

The SEDAC is a Data Center in NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS).  This center is hosted by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University, New York, USA, and it stores data on several human dimensions of Earth Science. 

On September 25th 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), designed to engage all countries and all stakeholders in a collaborative partnership to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all.  

As you develop your solution, consider the following:

For example: 



Think of your own examples to craft stories of human-environment interactions!



### Trace Invaders

> Develop a tool to trace invasive species in your
neighborhood over time!

![Trace Invaders](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/ea2KGAqTUW68QesgGme-rL8jNVo=/658/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Ecosystems around the world are facing threats from aliens!  These aliens may be Earthlings, but instead of coming in peace, these invaders can cause environmental or economic harm, or harm to human health.   When introduced to non-native habitats, invasive species (which can be plants, animals, or fungi) compete for the same space and resources of native species, and in some cases, they can drive an entire species to extinction!   Changes in climate patterns can further worsen the impacts of invasive species  on native species.

Your challenge is to develop a tool, such as a crowdsourcing application, to gather information about invasive species in your neighborhood.







### Where Genes Flow

> Map and compare population genetics of a species
with landscape features, climate conditions, and human activities in a region
to identify potential barriers or facilitators to gene migration and local
adaptation.

![Where Genes Flow](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/GxVBL6wMT1UpxbmyxXhT69pSnCo=/668/fill-1440x200-c100/)

When people move from one location to another, we may choose to travel light and not carry any belongings, but we carry with us assets that are just as personal and significant – our genes.  The same is true for other species that migrate away from their native populations into new areas and new communities.  Their movement and subsequent incorporation into new populations leads to the transfer of genes, and thus, traits, into new populations.  

This migration of genes, or “gene flow,” is influenced by a variety of factors, including the physiology, mobility, and behaviors of the individuals, and also by their surrounding landscapes and environments.  The interplay of these factors leads to unique patterns of gene flow and local adaptation for different species in the same environment and vice versa.  Understanding these patterns of flow is important not only to advance the knowledge of ecology and evolution, but also to guide the management of threatened and endangered species. 

Your challenge is to overlay population genetics data pertaining to a species of your choice on a map of a region of your choice.  Compare the distribution of different genes, alleles, and/or traits with landscape features, climate conditions, and human activities in the region to identify potential barriers or facilitators of gene flow!





## Warning Danger Ahead

### When Landslides Strike

> Design an easy-to-use tool to allow the public to discover and understand landslide data, and to contribute their own observations for use by emergency managers.

![When Landslides Strike](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/qq4EqUp_pRabZI-FAy6raYAgsPQ=/654/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Landslides are one of the most universal hazards in the world, and have caused more than 11,500 fatalities in 70 countries between 2007-2010 [1].  The most frequent trigger of landslides is intense and prolonged rainfall, which saturates soil on vulnerable slopes.  However, the location of extreme precipitation isn't always the location of the resulting disaster.  Weather forecasting can help predict future landslide events, while studying previous events can provide clues to identify locations that are most vulnerable to experiencing landslide impacts.  

NASA’s Global Landslide Catalog (GLC)* was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall, which have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources.

These important landslide data would have greater impacts the more accessible and discoverable they are.  

Your challenge is to design a tool with visualization and crowd-sourcing capabilities to allow users to discover and understand landslide data, and to contribute their own observations easily.

  Make sure that the tool is easy to use, and the information easily accessible and understandable by the public and emergency managers who must respond to these types of disasters.



You may consider the following options as you design your tool:

- Build an interactive visualization tool that allows overlaying of landslide data and images on popular Earth browsers, or Earth mapping websites. 

- Design a crowd sourcing data collection framework.

- Consider options to compare landslide data with other variables.

- Allow user-tagging of social media posts







### And You Can Help Fight Fires

> Build a fire-monitoring and crowdsourcing tool that will allow local fire managers to respond to wildfires.

![And You Can Help Fight Fires](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/DKJ6YtGupUJVsvYOc62MT-zOx_Y=/665/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Fires are increasing across landscapes throughout the world due to increased drought, increased temperatures, and human-driven changes (e.g., deforestation). When the weather is extreme, the fires are extreme, often spreading beyond countries’ abilities to fight them. Fires can move quickly though landscapes and communities, causing immediate damage and extreme health risks due to smoke pollution. 

Often, fires are so big that it is impossible to: (1) see the best paths out; (2) see the best paths available for rescue or fire management vehicles to enter; and (3) estimate where post-fire effects will be the strongest (debris flows, landslides). However, satellite data can see the entire landscape and help with valuable information for those who need it most! 

Develop a tool that combines satellite data with crowd-sourced data from people on the ground near areas of concern, to help firefighters identify:

Take your tool a step further and incorporate short-term and long-term environmental data, such as regional weather systems, rainfall, etc., to predict post-wildfire hazardous events, including:





### Mayday Mayday Mayday

> Calculate and visualize the radiation exposure for an actual or hypothetical polar, or near-polar flight!

![Mayday Mayday Mayday](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/sy9dcGwMkU0a-yo-4eIbPJqf1kM=/652/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Earth is constantly being bombarded by radiation from our universe, including from the sun.  The Earth’s magnetic field deflects much of this radiation, protecting us from harmful effects.  However, at the North and South poles, Earth’s magnetic field no longer provides shielding, and instead accelerates radiation into the Earth’s atmosphere.  You may have seen the result of electrons colliding with our atmosphere in the form of the Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) and Aurora Australis (Southern Lights)!

While people on the ground have atmospheric protection, those at higher altitudes are at greater risk of radiation exposure.  For example, airline pilots and crew are particularly vulnerable from constant exposure to higher levels of radiation, especially when they fly over or near magnetic poles!

Your challenge is to visualize radiation exposure for the flight crew and passengers of a polar or near-polar flight.  Choose an historical, current, or a hypothetical flight path that includes flying over or near one of the magnetic poles.  Calculate and visualize the radiation exposure for the people on that flight based on auroral conditions at the time of the flight. 



### Every Cloud

> Map severe weather conditions with the presence of local atmospheric
aerosols to identify potential connections!

![Every Cloud](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/gYGCxzKpkauZJb9aZjpuPwDWAuY=/656/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Airborne particles, or aerosols, float up to 50 km in the Earth’s atmospheric layers, from the Earth’s surface up to the stratosphere.  These particles can be natural—for example volcanic ash or sulfates generated from naturally released sulfur gases.  Aerosols can also be formed from human activities—for example, black carbon generated from burning of farm waste and clearing lands, and sulfates generated as a consequence of fossil fuel combustion.[1] 

Atmospheric aerosols have many impacts, including serving as “seeds” for cloud formation.  Aerosol type and abundance, as well as environmental conditions determine variations in the types of clouds formed, and the impact on the climate.  For example, in certain conditions, an abundance of aerosols can enhance the life span of clouds, causing more severe rainfall, which can result in flooding.[2]   In other cases, adding aerosols to an environment already conducive to thunderstorm development can increase the likelihood of tornadoes![3]

Your challenge is to map severe weather as well as various sources of atmospheric aerosols around the world, and identify potential patterns of connection between particles and environmental impact. 

 You can take your solution a step further and classify patterns based on the types and abundance of airborne particles, as well as pre-existing local weather patterns.

## Planetary Blues

### Wheres Water

> Use satellite and other data to allow farmers, landowners, and land managers in your locale to identify and visualize water resources in their surroundings.

![Wheres Water](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/kRdZCdOuXeQVgnTS75HUa1fjPCE=/660/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Farmers, land owners, and land managers need to be able to understand their nearby water resources and how the water may change in availability, quantity, and location over time.

Your challenge is to use satellite and other data to allow these stakeholders in your community to visualize and understand your landscapes and the sources of water near you. 

 Use data from Earth-observing satellites to identify the broad sweep of groundwater levels below you and surface water supplies, and determine how environmental conditions affect these water resources.

Track the identified resources over time to see how water levels have changed over time (seasons to years). 

How can you combine the satellite and other data with local knowledge to help stakeholders understand why these changes may be taking place?





### Icy Polar Opposites

> Design a data analysis and/or visualization tool to show the spatial and temporal changes in Arctic and Antarctic ice to a general audience.

![Icy Polar Opposites](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/UDkwxcwrKLVWqhQG7lTAfcHL-uw=/655/fill-1440x200-c100/)

The Arctic and Antarctica are polar opposites, not just because they house the North and South Poles, respectively, but also because their geographies are opposite as well!  The Arctic is a semi-closed ocean almost entirely surrounded by land, while Antarctica is a landmass that is entirely surrounded by an ocean.



Data about ice at the poles aren’t just useful to scientists who study the cryosphere, but they are also useful for international trade (sea ice forecasts for the Northwest Passage), and planetary science (comparing changing ice on Earth to that on other planets).

NASA studies help us understand how ice structures in the Arctic and Antarctica are evolving in a changing environment. In addition to presence and absence of sea ice, ice sheets are also observed in three dimensions, so that measurements of how the sheets are changing from above and below, as well as side-to-side, can be made.



Analyze and visualize NASA’s Arctic and/or Antarctic ice sheets and sea ice data to tell their story over time and over the three spatial dimensions.

  In addition to seasonal changes in the extent of the ice, are there other patterns of change to be seen?  For example, are there differences in ice coverage in the same location between one day of the year (e.g. April 29, 2017) and the same day of other years (April 29, 2016; April 29, 2015; and so on…)?









### Water Water Everywhere

> Develop a tool that provides emergency management personnel with an up-to-date flood-risk map for an area of interest.

![Water Water Everywhere](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/t-pyFxsEPWJW_eD5eP-ktCxSxsA=/661/fill-1440x200-c100/)

Flooding is a pervasive natural hazard with devastating consequences on people’s lives, homes, and livelihoods. Mapping floodwater extent for active floods is critical for local and regional officials, and also for disaster relief workers who are trying to determine where to focus their efforts.  Additionally, it can be critical to monitor vulnerable regions for water pollution, or the spread of water-borne illnesses like cholera.

Your challenge is to develop a tool that displays an up-to-date flood-risk map for an area of interest and is easy for the public to use and understand. 

 The ideal solution should be general enough to apply to any area worldwide for which sufficient relevant data are available.



Consider combining satellite, airborne, 



 and/or simulation data from different sources. These may include:



Consider overlaying data on human factors that influence flood-related hazards, such as:



### Arctic Game

> Design a mobile game that helps document the local Arctic environment by crowdsourcing photos and information, while enhancing intercultural and intergenerational learning in the Inupiaq communities.

![Arctic Game](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/OuuiVn6s-1nnoHElDLRrkDqFVyQ=/669/fill-1440x200-c100/)

In recent decades, the Arctic region has been experiencing unprecedented ecological and social changes. One of the challenges facing Alaskan Native communities in the Arctic is maintaining and transferring local and indigenous knowledge to younger generations, as young Inupiaq hunters lack opportunities to take part in all seasonal subsistence activities. Thus, activities that strengthen community social networks, allow the sharing of information between generations, and increase understanding of the local environment, are extremely meaningful for cultural preservation, food security, and climate resilience in Arctic communities. 

Help promote communication between Elders and the youth, as well as encourage young hunters to document their environment in their own local language, through a mobile game!  Allow the integration and comparison of local observations with satellite data to increase our understanding of the Arctic as a system, to create records of climate conditions over time, and to promote adaptation strategies. 



The aim is to develop a game that will motivate young hunters to collect environmental data (e.g. pictures of ice floes) with their mobile phones, classify the data in the Inupiaq language together with their Elders and/or whaling captains, and share their findings with scientists. 

Design your game to help young hunters make scientifically informed decisions that reduce their vulnerability to environmental hazards.

In the Arctic, the weather can change within seconds, exposing hunters to potential dangers. Hunters must be able to quickly and correctly recognize and interpret visualizations to avoid distractions from their primary task. Consider incorporating tools and features to aid young hunters better interpret satellite images. 

Extreme cold weather poses significant challenges to motor skills, limiting finger-based interactions on mobile phones. Therefore, the part of the game which involves “data collection” should be simplified with intuitive and responsive user interfaces, whilst the “social” part of the game, which involves classifying the data with Elders and whaling captains, updating social media status etc., could be more interactive and entertaining.

As internet connectivity in the Arctic can be unreliable, consider methods to adapt the game to this constraint.  For example, you could allow data collection in the absence of internet connectivity, and subsequent data synchronization when the user is connected to a wireless or mobile network. 

Possible features to include in your game: 



## Earth And Us

### Lets Go Beach

> Build a tool for beach-goers to monitor for hazards and to alert them of precautionary measures for protection on their swim- and surf-filled adventures!

![Lets Go Beach](https://api-2017.spaceappschallenge.org/images/HcjQvIwLSPS6ewwAGzWW4L1sgy0=/653/fill-1440x200-c100/)

The salty smell of the ocean, the sand beneath your feet, the breeze in your hair, and the warmth of the sun– who doesn’t love going to the beach?  

But before we jump in our swimsuits, let’s make sure we are well prepared!

According to the World Health Organization [1], overexposure to sunlight can cause harm to our skin, our eyes, and our immune systems.  In fact, protecting ourselves from UV damage, for example by using hats, sunglasses, and sunscreen, can prevent four out of five cases of skin cancer. 

Additionally, harmful algal blooms (HABs) can also pose a threat at your next beach trip.  According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, HABs occur when colonies of algae in the sea and in freshwater grow out of control [2].  They can produce toxins that cause rashes, breathing problems, and liver damage [3].  Satellite-based images of ocean color can help forecast the presence of HABs in water bodies, and can direct you to HAB-free beach areas near you!

Develop a tool that alerts beach-goers to the precautions they need to take before heading out to the shores. 

 

-Predict their sun exposure based on: 

-Suggest alternative times of the day, or days when sun exposure levels are lower.

-Warn users of presence of HABs in local beaches, and direct them to safer regions, where available.

-Add other precautionary and safety alerts as you see fit!



-Explain the data in easy-to-grasp ways.

-Add informative layers in your tool to explain to users the science behind the data and recommendations. 

-Consider combining sun exposure data with weather forecasting to warn beach-goers of unpredictable and rapidly emerging conditions.

-Consider adding a game component in your tool to encourage the public to take proper precautions before heading out to the beach!

Earth-orbiting spacecrafts, such as the International Space Station (ISS), require a source of power to be able to perform various functions in space.  For example, ISS relies on electrical power to allow the crew to live comfortably, operate the station, and perform scientific experiments. 

In space, the sun is a readily available source of energy.  NASA has, and continues to develop technologies to convert sunlight into power for ISS and satellite missions, including the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2).  These technologies include photovoltaic systems (such as solar panels) and solar batteries, which are charged during the sunlit part of the spacecraft’s orbit, storing energy to be used when the spacecraft is not in direct sunlight.

Solar energy technologies are critical to current Earth-observing missions, as well as to our next steps in deep space, including the journey to Mars.  Additionally, these technologies have significant applications for ensuring access to reliable and sustainable energy for all on Earth. 

In fact, the current NASA-funded Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation V (HI-SEAS V), a habitat on an isolated Mars-like site on the Mauna Loa side of the Big Island of Hawaii, relies on photovoltaic panels and solar batteries to power its long-duration Mars analog simulation studies.  The crew of six uses electricity generated by solar technologies to conduct activities ranging from conducting experiments to cooking and exercising, and thus they must strictly calculate and monitor energy generation by their solar panels.   

The concept of solar energy is not instinctively tangible.  While we may appreciate the capacity of solar panels and solar batteries, many of us don’t understand how much energy a solar panel actually produces.

Your challenge is to create a means to help people understand how much energy comes from a solar panel.  Take your solution a step further, and create a tool to allow the HI-SEAS crew, or other explorers reliant on solar panels, to plan their daily energy consumption for all their human necessities and other planned activities based on expected energy output from solar panels.





### Whats Dinner

The growing human population presents challenges to ensuring that all people have access to safe and nutritious food.  A changing climate is of further concern for risks to sustainable food supplies, and vulnerability of populations to environmental and other shocks.  Addressing these challenges of food security involves approaches to improve agricultural practices, while ensuring that the environmental impacts of these practices are minimal.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, almost one-third of the food produced for human consumption is wasted every year![1]  This waste is a tremendous missed opportunity for improving food security and simultaneously minimizing environmental impacts, such as air pollution, landscape degradation, water use, biodiversity loss, and deforestation.[2] 

Employing life cycle analyses (LCAs) to evaluate all stages in the production and consumption of food, including raw material growth or production, processing, distribution, use, and disposal, can facilitate integration of environmental impact assessment in decision-making.

Your challenge is to map the life cycle of your favorite food or dish and integrate seasonal environmental patterns to determine the best time and way to eat it!  Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the processes that bring the food to your plate— from growing crops and managing livestock to transporting products into your city.  Use Earth observations to assess agricultural productivity and identify environmental risks to sustainability.



-Consider the spatial and temporal distributions of crop production for the food products/ingredients of your interest.  

-Does your food item have a short shelf life or spoil easily?  Can measures be taken to improve the shelf life of these items?  Do these improvement measures come at additional environmental costs? 

-Are there alternative uses for these end-of-life waste products, including spoiled food?

Population dynamics, changes in climate, and diversity of available resources all influence the quality of life in urban and rural areas.  Applying innovative techniques and using data creatively to research and plan urban and rural areas will help improve residents’ lives and help preserve social, economic, and environmental resources for future generations.   

Your challenge is to plan next-generation sustainable cities, towns, and villages that integrate data and smart/connected technologies in various domains, including energy, education, transportation, agriculture, environment, and health.  Ensure that the benefits of smart planning are accessible to all populations.



You can design a high-level plan of smart cities, towns, and villages, or develop tools and ideas that contribute to smart planning and running of these settlements. 

Your solution can address any or all of the following topics:

Have you ever gazed out the window of a flying airplane and wondered what you’re flying over– geography, points of interest, plants and animal habitats?  Have you wondered how these features have changed over time? 

Your challenge is to build a tool that will allow pilots and passengers to identify geographic, natural, and cultural locations of interest along their flight path. 

 

You can take the challenge a step further and provide tool users the options to learn more about each location or point of interest including: history, significance, change over time, and features that can be identified from the sky!
